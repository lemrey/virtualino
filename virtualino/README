==========

---
The project is managed by maven. Run the following to install pde.jar and openblocks.jar into the local repository.

	$ mvn validate

Run the following to compile the project

	$ mvn compile
	
Finally

	$ mvn package

to package the project in a jar file
	
The jar package (virtualino-all.jar) will be placed in ./target, run the following to execute it

	$ java -jar virtualino-all.jar
	
Virtualino's window will then show up :)
	
***NOTE*** Virtualino will look for the emulator 'simduino.elf' in its working directory.
Place the 'simduino.elf' file in the same directory as the jar archive.
Make sure the program is set to executable.
